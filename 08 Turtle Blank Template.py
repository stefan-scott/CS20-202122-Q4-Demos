# A first foray into using the turtle library

import turtle       # looks for a file called turtle.py
                    # it will look for it in the lib folder
                    # but it will look in the same folder
                    # as this program first.
                    #
                    # so don't name your file turtle.py !!!!
                    
# create and setup a window object
window = turtle.Screen()


# create at least one turtle object
my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()
